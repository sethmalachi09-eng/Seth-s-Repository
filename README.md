This repository was made to gain understanding of how collaborations between organsiations and people work, through means of code
I first created a github account, chose one of my classmates to assist with overviewing this sample code, created my first branch, created a file which printed both my first name and last name and finally awaited my partner to review this code.
The collaborator, namely Shelisa Mohammed and myself Seth Welch the creator.
